### The idea about the project:
In the Corona closure among the essential stores that were open the optics stores were always open as well.
Why? Because glasses are an essential need! A person has already seen his life without glasses that are very hard and sometimes even impossible, it is not just written that 'a blind man is as important as dead'.
And if you say you can order glasses without going to the store? Maybe they will do a check-up with a doctor and then order the glasses from home?
This is a ridiculous idea because a person who does not wear glasses that suit him - and even these will be the most beautiful and fashionable glasses - can look terrible and awful.
Against this background came up the idea of ​​my project: to allow people to sit at home and measure glasses until they buy the glasses that best suit them.
It is true that closures in Gaza will no longer exist, but shopping from home is not an idea that came up just following the corona. There are many people who prefer this way of shopping. Especially for them was built my site - a site that allows them to buy the glasses that suit them without leaving home.

### Project structure:
The project has navigation to the following pages:
Home page, information sheet, store, and clear order status placed (marked with a drawing of glasses).
The store has pairs of glasses, each pair has a picture of the glasses, their price, and 2 buttons - one for measuring and one for buying. The measurement button opens a model where the user sees himself with the glasses through the computer camera and checks if the glasses fit him. If he is indeed interested in buying them he will also press the buy button. The buy button will open a model for him where he will enter his personal details, attach a file of an eye test, and send the order. The order will enter the database, and create an order code that will be sent to it by email. Using the code he can see where his glasses are now on the dedicated page. The glasses will be in the 'order' mode for 10 minutes, then 10 waxes in the 'preparation' mode, then 12 hours in the 'delivery' mode and then in the 'ready' mode. The ready-made glasses will reach his home and he will pay in cash to the courier. Stand clear order status on the site, but the link will only pass if on a computer where only the project is being checked at the same time.
